\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Domain Problem}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Domain Problem}
  \framesubtitle{Introduction}

NOTES:\\
- Molecular biology is a new subject.\\
- Many unknowns.\\
- Gene expression is important...\\
- Two areas of interest of IBMC experts: differential expression and RBPs.\\

\end{frame}

\subsection{Motivation and Objectives}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivation and Objectives}
  \framesubtitle{Introduction}

NOTES:\\
Motivation:\\
- Many tools require a very technical set of skills (tools should be facilitators, not hindrances)\\
- Some tasks need automation.\\
- Lots of information, often scattered in multiple places.\\
Objectives:\\
- Build simples tools that require minimal skill.\\
- Automate processes.\\
- Aggregate as much relevant information as possible.\\

\end{frame}

% SOLUTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Developed Solution}
\subsection{Overview}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Overview}
  \framesubtitle{Developed Solution}

NOTES:\\
- Two computer systems, one for each domain problem.\\
- Both accessible through the web.\\
- Focus on small system footprint, deployable by machine, department, institution.\\
\end{frame}

\subsection{RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline}
  \framesubtitle{Developed Solution}

NOTES:\\
- Show scheme, refer iRAP, the script and the web interface.\\
- Refer multiple differential expression tools.\\
- Refer user input and tool configuration.\\

\end{frame}

\subsection{RBP Analysis Pipeline (PBS Finder)}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{RBP Analysis Pipeline (PBS Finder)}
  \framesubtitle{Developed Solution}

NOTES:\\
- Show scheme, RBP finding, gene enrichment, clustering.\\
- Refer web interface.
- Refer that the tools is in production for several months, being extensively tested by experts.\\
- Refer user input and tool configuration.\\

\end{frame}

\subsection{Integration}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Integration}
  \framesubtitle{Developed Solution}

NOTES:\\
- Differential expression analysis could benefit from gene enrichment.\\
- Do we really need two separate platforms?\\
- Joined together, user choses what analysis to perform.\\
- Still separate viewing experiences.\\

\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Objective Fulfilment}
  \framesubtitle{Conclusions}

NOTES:\\
- All PBS Finder functionality implemented.\\
- Differential expression analysis pipeline deployed, combination script created.\\
- It was not possible to integrate with web platform, due to time constraints.\\
