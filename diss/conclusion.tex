In this thesis we proposed the development of an integrated platform for RNA-Seq
data analysis. This platform is able to perform the entirety of the analysis
process, from the sequencing reads, to grouping genes by their RBPs. This means
being able to perform read alignment, quantification and differential expression
analysis tasks, as well as data set enrichment, RBP identification and
clustering analysis of genes and proteins. Through a case study we showed the
developed prototype in action, and assessed its correctness and efficiency.
Below we will share our thoughts on the fulfilment of the objectives of this
thesis, and present some possibilities for any future development in our
solution.

\section{Objective Fulfilment}

Our objectives, in terms of studying the problem at hand and developing a
solution to it, were completely fulfilled. The proposed solution corresponds to
all of our expectations. However, as previously discussed, the implementation of
the RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline system was not completed, due to time
constraints. As such, our objective of prototyping and testing the complete
system could not be completely achieved.

\section{Future Work}

The obvious continuation of the proposed work would be to finish the
implementation and integration of the RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline. This would
allow our solution to work as designed, integrating the complete analysis
pipeline, from sequencing data to gene clustering and result visualization.
Furthermore, it would be interesting to study the developed tools in terms of
performance, under large volumes of information and requests. Whilst the tools
were developed taking in consideration their performance, making them available
in a large scale would take another kind of infrastructure.
