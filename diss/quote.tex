    Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They
    think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the
    machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will
    something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact
    we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or
    operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the
    slaves.
