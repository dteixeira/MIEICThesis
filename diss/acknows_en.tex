\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all, I would like to direct my gratitude to my supervisor, Rui Camacho
(FEUP). His concern about my work and the helpfulness he has always shown were
key factors for the success of this project. I extend the same gratitude to my
co-supervisor, Nuno Fonseca (EMBL-EBI), for his endless patience in answering my
questions.

I would also like thank Alexandra Moreira, Andrea Cruz and Jaime Freitas (IBMC)
for the fantastic way they always welcomed me. Their willingness to help me
through the difficult of learning a completely new field of study was
fundamental to my progress.

A very special thank you to my all my friends at FEUP, that were with me in what
is surely one of the best periods in my life. In particular I would like to
acknowledge Pedro Borges. Our constant competition, along with our shared
antics, made working on this project that much more fun and fulfilling.

To my parents, Joaquim Teixeira and Maria Silva, I leave a truly heartfelt thank
you; for all the nights they spent awake worrying about me; for all their
guidance and wisdom; for being with me in every good and bad moment of my life.
I would not be the person I am today without them.

Lastly, but definitely not least, I thank my girlfriend, Raquel Sacramento. Of
everything I have and owe to her, nothing is more important than the smile she
puts on my face every day, as she gives me the strength to face the world.
