  abstract = {Low-cost short read sequencing technology has revolutionized
  genomics, though it is only just becoming practical for the high-quality de
  novo assembly of a novel large genome. We describe the Assemblathon 1
  competition, which aimed to comprehensively assess the state of the art in
  de novo assembly methods when applied to current sequencing technologies. In
  a collaborative effort, teams were asked to assemble a simulated Illumina HiSeq
  data set of an unknown, simulated diploid genome. A total of 41 assemblies from
  17 different groups were received. Novel haplotype aware assessments of
  coverage, contiguity, structure, base calling, and copy number were made. We
  establish that within this benchmark: (1) It is possible to assemble the genome
  to a high level of coverage and accuracy, and that (2) large differences exist
  between the assemblies, suggesting room for further improvements in current
  methods. The simulated benchmark, including the correct answer, the assemblies,
  and the code that was used to evaluate the assemblies is now public and freely
  available from http://www.assemblathon.org/.},

@article{Wolf2013,
  abstract = {Genome-wide analyses and high-throughput screening was long reserved
  for biomedical applications and genetic model organisms. With the rapid
  development of massively parallel sequencing nanotechnology (or
  next-generation sequencing) and simultaneous maturation of bioinformatic
  tools, this situation has dramatically changed. Genome-wide thinking is
  forging its way into disciplines like evolutionary biology or molecular
  ecology that were historically confined to small-scale genetic approaches.
  Accessibility to genome-scale information is transforming these fields, as
  it allows us to answer long-standing questions like the genetic basis of
  local adaptation and speciation or the evolution of gene expression profiles
  that until recently were out of reach. Many in the eco-evolutionary sciences
  will be working with large-scale genomic data sets, and a basic understanding of
  the concepts and underlying methods is necessary to judge the work of others.
  Here, I briefly introduce next-generation sequencing and then focus on
  transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). This article gives a broad overview
  and provides practical guidance for the many steps involved in a typical RNA-seq
  work flow from sampling, to RNA extraction, library preparation and data
  analysis. I focus on principles, present useful tools where appropriate and
  point out where caution is needed or progress to be expected. This tutorial is
  mostly targeted at beginners, but also contains potentially useful reflections
  for the more experienced.},

@article{Pusztai01062003,
  abstract = {DNA microarrays represent an important new tool to analyze human
  tissues. The technology enables investigators to measure the expression of
  several thousand mRNA species simultaneously in a biological specimen. This
  process, called transcriptional profiling, represents a technological
  breakthrough in the analysis of biological specimens. It may be used to screen
  for individual genes that are differentially expressed between normal and
  diseased tissues in the hope of finding novel targets for drug development or
  finding new single-gene markers of clinical outcome. Microarrays are also
  applied to learn about the complex biology of cancer by simultaneously
  monitoring interactions between hundreds of genes during experimental conditions
  in vitro or during therapy in vivo. Analysis of gene expression patterns may
  also be used as a classification tool to sort cancer into various clinically
  relevant subgroups that is not currently possible with other methods. The first
  clinically important applications of this technology will likely be its use as a
  tool to refine diagnosis and improve the accuracy of predictions of prognosis
  and response to therapy. DNA microarrays in several “proof-of-principle”
  experiments have demonstrated that they can predict important clinical outcomes,
  including outcomes that cannot currently be predicted with other methods, but
  the true clinical utility and the limits of this exciting new technology are
  yet to be established. This paper reviews the current methodology and
  applications of this technique as they relate to clinical oncology.},
